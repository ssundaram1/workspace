Q: Declare a binary tree data structure in Java.
   Only a class for a node, with
   data members to hold an integer,
   and two references to (optional) child nodes.

public class BinaryTree{
public class Node{

int data;
Node left;
Node right;

}

}

=====================
public class Node {
  int data;
  Node left;
  Node right;
}

Q: Write a function named "dump", which
   takes a reference to a binary tree node,
   returns a string representation of the tree.
   (1) For a null reference returns "".
   (2) For a leaf node returns the integer number in string like "1234".
   (3) For a non-leaf node returns string like: "T(1234,T(5,12,),T(12,,3))"
       T(<int-value>,<LeftTree>,<RightTree>)

T(1234,T(
String tree =””;
public String dump(Node n ,String tree){
if(n == null){
 return tree; // no extra space
}
if(n.left == null && n.right == null){
 return tree +n.data+”)”; // no extra space
}else if {
    tree = “T(”+n.data+”,”;
    dump(n.left);
    tree+”)”;
    // missing “,”
    tree = tree + “,”;
     dump(n.right);
    return tree;

}


}   

O(n*m)



Assume a function named "parse", which
   takes a string generated by "dump" and
   returns a reference to a binary tree,
   or returns null for an ill-format string.

   Note that dump(parse(dump(P))) should be identical to dump(P),
   and parse(dump(P)) should be equivalent to P,
   for any reference P.


Q: What is dynamic programming algorithm?
Tell me one example algorithm.

Q: How many unique paths are there to move from point (1,1) to point (N,M)
 a maze with NxM cells, move from one cell to the other,
each step can only go from (i,j) to (i+1,j), or (i,j+1), or (i+1,j+1).


O(N*M) time? O(N^2*M^2) or O(2^(N+M))

O(N^2)?
